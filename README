png2audioSpectrum creates audio spectra that are looking like an image that you can provide.
A spectrum is the frequency representation of a signal, in this case the sound.

Note: at the moment you can only use some pngs that are saves as monochrome images
maybe future updates will extend that. If you are unclear about what I mean look 
at the example image as this should work perfectly.

Usage: 
    1. have a file img.png in the same folder as the script
    2. run 'python pn2audioSpectrum.py'
    3. after finishing successfully you have a file calles png2audioSpectrum.wav in the same folder as the script

Dependencies:

    Python Imaging Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
    NumPy
